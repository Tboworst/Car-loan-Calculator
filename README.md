Car Loan calculator by @Tboworst 

This is a simple car loan calculator which will help users estmate how their monthly payments based on the loan amount, their credit score, monthly revenue and loan term.
Additionaly users will be given their "required" salary to afford the car of their choice. 
Users will have the option to view their amortization schedule based on their loan term and interest rate to give a detailed overview. Allows the user to save results to a file to come back to later.


My project is still a work in progress, I plan to expand it into a full-stack application:

#Backend

- Current marketplace cars/adding more car listings(Via the use of an API. e.g Vehicle database found this online)
- Build an API to take requests for the car data and loan calculations

#Frontend
- Develop a web interface using framework such as React 
- Include filters for the car models,year and mileage(will be like an extension of the live market API)
- Add a line graph to help users visualize the market value of the cars

#Fullstack 
- Use backend frame(flask) and frontend(react)
- Deploy the application
